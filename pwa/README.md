# 311 Agent - Progressive Web App

This directory contains the source code for the 311 Agent Progressive Web App (PWA). It's a modern React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and TanStack Router.

For a high-level overview of the entire project, please see the [**root README.md**](../README.md).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

## ðŸ§  A Note on the AI Model
